The new "Day Light Block" and "Night Light Block" act similar to Vanilla's Light Block.
They emit light based on the current time of day. For performance adjustments you can change the newly added
`day_night_light_check_interval` GameRule which defines the tick intervals in which the BlockEntities are checking
for the current progress of the day.
